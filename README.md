# HelloWorld_Extended
My extension of Sumo Digitals Playbuffer Tutorial.
Language C++, Framework: Playbuffer - Provided by Sumo Digital for the Sumo Academy Internship.

```
I have extended the original game by adding a second player controlled using the mouse cursor.

This required me to understand and adapt the following systems:
- Player object and states
- Input
- Game States
- Sprite rendering

I also added logic to change the way scoring worked to better reflect the extended game.
